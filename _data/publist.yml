  description: CAR-T cell therapy is an effective cancer therapy for multiple refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies but is associated with substantial toxicity, including Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). We developed the Visual EEG-ICANS (VE-ICANS) grading scale, a grading scale with a physiological basis that has a strong correlation to ICANS severity. VE-ICANS shows promise as a biomarker for ICANS which could help to improve clinical care through greater accuracy in assessing ICANS severity..

- title: "Puddle formation, persistent gaps, and non-mean-field breakdown of superconductivity in overdoped (Pb,Bi)2Sr2CuO6+Î´"
  image: BSCCOgap.png
  description: Why do cuprate superconductors stop superconducting past a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.

- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"

  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

- title: "Automated scoring of respiratory events in sleep with a single effort belt and deep neural networks"
  image: dummy.png
  description: The current gold standard of diagnosing sleep-disordered breathing, using polysomnography and manual analysis, is time-consuming, expensive, and only applicable in dedicated clinical environments. Our fully automated method using a single effort belt signal overcomes these limitations and can detect respiratory events and assess the AHI accurately.
